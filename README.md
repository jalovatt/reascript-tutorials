Tutorials and examples for scripting in Reaper

This repo is mostly just a placeholder while I work on amassing enough content to justify a proper website. I'm hoping to move and fix up things like my GUI tutorial from the Reaper forum, in addition.

- Anything and everything could change if I feel like it. As I said, it's a place to keep stuff.

- Suggestions for content are more than welcome. I have a lengthy list already, but there are many special cases or topics that I'm sure I haven't thought about.
